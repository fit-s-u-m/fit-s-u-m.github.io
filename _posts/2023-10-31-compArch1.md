## So what is computer architecture?

### 1.1 **Organization and architecture**

---

**Computer architecture** is an attribute of a computer that have direct impact on the logical execution.  
**computer organization** is operational units and thier interconnections that realizes the architectural specifications.

When building a system first we build the <mark>structure</mark> then we <mark>organize</mark> our resource to achive the final result.

    <td> memory ðŸ’¾</td>
    <td> Instraction set</td>

  <tr>
    <td>interface b/n computer and peripherals</td>
    <td>I/O mechanisms</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>computer signals</td>
    <td>addressing memory</td>
  </tr>

### 1.2 **Structure and function**

**Structure** is a way that commponets are interrelated  
**function** is the operation of each indvidual component as part of the structure

There are four basic functions that computers perform
