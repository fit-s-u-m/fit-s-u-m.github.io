## What is power system

power system is a network of high tension wire cable where the generated electrical power is transmitted and distributed.   
<br>
constits of: -
  - Generation
  - Transmittion  
     - step up and down station
     - Transmittion line
  - Distribution
    - it gives out the energy from medium voltage substation to custumer's location
  - Energy sink(The load)
    - its the end of the power system where the energy is converted to other usefull form of energy.

Since power is equal to the product of voltage and current.
we can increase the power by increasing the two.
  - icreasing the current level.<mark> needs larger conductor cross section</mark>
  - increasing the voltage level. <mark>needs more insulation</mark>  

There are two types of Transmittion DC And AC 

both have there own merit and demerit  

### Advantage of DC Transmittion
  - uses only two conductors instade of using three
  - it have only active power this means
    - no inductance
    - no capacitance
    - phase displacement
  - since it have no inductance the voltage
