## Quantum computers 

### single systems
  - classical information
  - quantum information
    - auantum state vectors
    - standard basis measurement
    - unitary operation

A system is an abstraction of a physical device or a medium that stores information.

What is classical information ?

suppose that we have a system that stores information and one of a finite number of classical states at each instant.
lets call X is the system and Y(sigma) is the state
