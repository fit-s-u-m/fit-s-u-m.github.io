## <u>The C lang</u>

line stating with pownd <mark>#</mark> is a preprocessor directive the main function is called main and returns an <mark>int</mark> if it run correct or not

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
  printf("Hello world\n");
}
```

to run c program you can use either gcc or clang

in C you can have many variables

- int (unsingned, signed)
  - char 1 byte
  - short 2 bytes
  - int 4 bytes
  - long 4 bytes
  - long long 8 bytes
- float
- double

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main (){
  float salary = 2.142525;
  double bonus = 3.141592632384;
  char inital = 'F';
  printf("this month salary for %c \n is %f and bonus is %f",inital ,salary, bonus);
}
```

but this values can vary depending of the compiler and processor you can have diffrent wiggle room for number of bytes.  
to use strict type you can use<mark>stdint.h</mark> as a header file
and define int8_t to be int of 8 bits
they are always the same size

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>
int main (){
  uint8_t number = 200; // 8 bits(untill 255)
  int64_t number2 = -1234; //64 bits
  printf("number: %i %i",number,number2);
}
```

## Arrays

The other thing is Arrays  
arrays are declared in C like this

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
  int arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
  int arr2[50];
  arr2[0]=45;
  arr2[49]=32412;
  printf("arr[0] is %i",arr[0]);
}
```

---

## Struct

they are like class they store data and keeps them together
e.g

```c
#include <stdio.h>
struct people{
  char name[20];
  int age;
  float height;
};
int main(){
  struct people me;
  struct people you;
  me.height=1.75;
  you.age=23;
  printf("my height is %f your age is %i",me.height,you.age);
}

```

---

## Pointers

pointers store the address of a variable.
you define pointers with the <mark>\*</mark>

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
  int number = 5;
  int *pointer = &number; // pointer to the address of number
  printf("pointer is %p,%i",pointer, *pointer); // 0x7ffc74b5257c,5
}
```

---

## pointers and Arrays

pointers and arrays are almost the same thing

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
  int arr[5]={1,2,3,4,5};
  int *p = arr;
  printf("%p pointes to %i\n",p,*p); // arr[0]
  printf("%p pointes to %i\n",p+1,*(p+1)); // arr[1]
  printf("%p pointes to %i\n",p+2,*(p+2)); // arr[2]
  printf("%p pointes to %i",p+3,*(p+3)); // arr[3]
  printf("%p pointes to %i",p+4,*(p+4)); //arr[4]
}

```

## i didn't understand the diffrence between pointers and arrays

## Strings in C

Strings are list of characters with a null character in the end to indicate the end of the string.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
  char str [] = "hello"; // array way
  char *str2 = "hello 2"; // pointer way
  printf("%s %s",str,str2);
}
```

### here is an example to get the length of a string

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int getstrlen(char *str){
  int offset=0;
  while(str[offset]!=0){ // till i get the null char loop
  offset++;
  }
  return offset;
}

int main(){
  char *str = "hello world";
  int strlen = getstrlen(str);
  printf("%i",strlen);
}

```

### also copy string to another string

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int getstrlen(char *str){
int offset=0;
while(str[offset]!=0){ // till i get the null char loop
offset++;
}
return offset;
}

int main(){
char *str = "hello world";
int strlen = getstrlen(str);
printf("%i",strlen);
}

```

but most string function are implimented in the string.h
so you can see the what methods it have in the termianl

```zsh
man string
```

## The use of pointer

To illustrate its use lets take an example from the _head first c book_

```c
#include <stdio.h>
void go_south_east(int lat,int lon){
  lat--;
  lon++;
}
int main(){
  int lattitude = 32;
  int longitude = 12;
  go_south_east(lattitude,longitude);
  printf("%i %i",lattitude,longitude);
}
```

what do you think will happen?
it will output 32,12 this is because by default c pass values to a function by cloning the value and giving it the funciton to do what ever it wants to do.
**this is called passing by value**  
But by using a pointer you can pass value's address to a fucntion instade of cloning.
data created by on function can be modified by another function.

As seen before
  - <mark>&x</mark> gets the address of x(referencing)
  - <mark>*y</mark> gets the value stored at location y(dereferencing)

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int x =5;
    printf("x lives in %p \n",&x);
    int *y = &x; // storing the address of x
    printf("x lives in %p \n",y);
    int z = *y // dereferencing or reading the pointer value
}

```
now we can go back to the previous example we had 
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void go_south_east(int *lat, int *lon) {
  *lat = *lat - 1; // dereference(get the value at that pointer) and decrement
  *lon = *lon + 1; // dereference and increment
}
int main() {
  int latitude = 32;
  int longtude = 23;
  go_south_east(&latitude, &longtude); // pass by reference
  printf("lat %i \nlong %i", latitude, longtude);
}

```
