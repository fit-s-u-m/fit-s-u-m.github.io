### coming back to arrays and pointers
When you create an array you can assign it to a pointer to the start of the array in memory
arrays can also be printed with printf as a pointer
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
  int arr[5];
  printf("the array start of the arrray is stored at %p",arr); 
    // the array start of the arrray is stored at 0x7fff212d11c0
}
```
you can understand the difference between pointers and arrays by this example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {  
  int contestants[] = {1, 2, 3};
  int *choice = contestants;
  contestants[0] = 2;
  contestants[1] = contestants[2];
  contestants[2] = *choice;
  printf("I'm going to pick contestant number %i\n", contestants[2]);
  return 0;
} 

```
in this example the array is a pointer to the start of the array and dereferencing that gives the first item

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {  
  int contestants[] = {1, 2, 3};
  int *choice = contestants; // reference to the first item in array
  contestants[0] = 2;
  contestants[1] = contestants[2];
  contestants[2] = *choice; // dereferencing the first item from the address
  printf("I'm going to pick contestant number %i\n", contestants[2]);
    // I'm going to pick contestant number 2
  return 0;
} 

```
## Now i get the difference between arrays and pointer
for example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
  char arr[]="hello world"; // array which is mutated(can be changed)
  char *arr1="hello world"; // pointer which is not mutated
  arr[0]='a';
  printf("%s-%s",arr, arr1);
    // aello world-hello world
}
```

so this mean that arrays are mutable and pointers are not they store at const address

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
  const char *arr="hello world";
  arr[0]='a';
  printf("%s-%s",arr, arr1);
    // error read-only variable is not assignable
}
```

**This will stop you from changing the variable at compile time**

The other thing you need to be carefull is **Pointer decay**  
when you pass an array to a pointer value you loss some information because the pointer variable will only contain the address of the array
it has no knowledge about size of the array so some information is lost in this process and its called <mark>decay</mark>.  
but every time you pass array to a function it is unavoidable. but you need to keep track of where the decay happed because it can cause subtle bugs.

#### array variable can't point anywhere else
  - once it point to array it can't point to other address

the other cool thing in c is 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
  int *arr = {1,2,3};
  printf("using pointers %i using array index %i",*(arr+2),arr[2]);
}

```
and because this kind of pointer arthimetic is why we give pointer a type
because you can add two and it knows how much to go in the address
