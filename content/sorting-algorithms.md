title: Algorithms
---


An **algorithm** is a ==step by step== set of instructions or
a process used to solve a problem or perform a task.
</br>
just like a **cooking book**

When you learn about algorithms the first thing that comes to mind is
**sorting**.

Sorting is the process of arranging items in a specific order.

The ability to sort help in many ways:

> [!example] for e.g
> + **Searching**
> + **Remove duplication**
> + **Scheduling**

But most of the time when we learn **data-structures and algorithms**
we just visualize the algorithms in our mind
this is what makes the course a little bit harder then it should be.

![This](https://fit-s-u-m.github.io/Algorithms-visualized/) 
is my way of trying to visualize some of the sorting algorithms i have learned.
