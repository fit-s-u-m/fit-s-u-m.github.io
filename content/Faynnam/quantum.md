I will try my best to understand and also explaining  

## what is the spooky thing about Quantum mechanics

As Feynman puts it

you have any direct experience about.

Many brilliant physicist tried to compare(e.g electron is like a wave)
or  nice way of putting it is they try to visualize what it feel like to
be a small sized electron for example.
Electron don't act like wave or particle or a rock or cloud.Atomic behaviour
is so unlike ordinary experience.
